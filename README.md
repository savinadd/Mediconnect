# MediConnect

MediConnect is a full-stack web application built with React for the frontend, Express.js for the backend, and PostgreSQL for the database. The system is designed to connect patients, doctors, and admins in a healthcare environment, allowing users to manage appointments, prescriptions, profiles, and communications through real-time chat. It implements Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for different user roles (patient, doctor, admin) with secure authentication and profile management.

## Features

- **Authentication & Authorization**: Users can register, log in, and securely manage their sessions. The app uses JWT for authentication and role-based access control (RBAC).
- **Profile Setup & Management**: Users must complete their profiles based on their role (patient, doctor, or admin) before they are fully registered.
- **Appointments**: Patients can book appointments with doctors, and doctors can view their schedules.
- **Prescription Management**: Doctors can add prescriptions for patients, which include the medication details, dosage, and instructions.
- **Real-time Chat**: Users (patients and doctors) can communicate in real-time through a live bidirectional chat system powered by Socket.IO.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Admins can manage users, view statistics, and monitor the platform's health.
